* Design your own scenario for machine learning. Is this a classification or regression task? Collect and label a sample dataset. Describe your steps for data collection. Where and how do you imagine the model being applied? What ethical considerations are there as related to your data and model? Write a response to the readings and describe your ML scenario. How did the readings inform the design of your ML model?
