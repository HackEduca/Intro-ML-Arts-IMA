#### Assignment:
* Create a blog (or category on a blog) for the course.
* Read [What is machine learning? We drew you another flowchart](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612437/what-is-machine-learning-we-drew-you-another-flowchart/) by Karen Hao
* Read [A People’s Guide to AI by Mimi Onuoha](https://www.alliedmedia.org/files/peoples-guide-ai.pdf) and Mother Cyborg (Diana Nucera)
* Read [Data & Society’s Algorithmic Accountability: A Primer](https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Data_Society_Algorithmic_Accountability_Primer_FINAL-4.pdf)
* Watch [Seeing Machines Think — Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Viégas](https://youtu.be/ugkfmHBW74Q)
* Watch [Kyle McDonald - Weird Intelligence](https://vimeo.com/304110435)
* Design your own scenario for machine learning. Is this a classification or regression task? Collect and label a sample dataset. Describe your steps for data collection. Where and how do you imagine the model being applied? What ethical considerations are there as related to your data and model? Write a response to the readings and describe your ML scenario. How did the readings inform the design of your ML model?
