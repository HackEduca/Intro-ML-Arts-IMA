### Assignment
1. Create a blog (or category on a blog) for the course. (You may use any means for publishing your assignments including, but not limited to a GitHub markdown file, google doc, medium post, etc.)
2. Using the [A People’s Guide to AI](https://www.alliedmedia.org/files/peoples-guide-ai.pdf) design a scenario for machine learning (it can be as fanstastical as you like). Follow the "Every Day AI activity" on page 23-28 and Embodying Social Algorithms from 36-41 and document your answers to the questions and diagrams in a blog post. Consider the following questions:
    * What are the inputs of your system?
    * What are the outputs of your system?
    * What is the training data? Does the data exist or does it need to be collected?
    * What are the ethical considerations of collecting this data and/or applying this model? Is there a danger that the model will harm individual people or a community? Are there privacy considerations with the data?
3. Post a link to your post on the [Homework Wiki Page for Assignment 1](https://github.com/ml5js/Intro-ML-Arts-IMA/wiki/Assignment-1)
