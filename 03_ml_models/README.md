## Session A: Other pre-trained models

### Objectives:
* Understanding how to use pre-trained models other than image classification.
* Ability to work with PoseNet and ml5.js
* Ability to work with UNet Image Segmenttaion and ml5.js.
* Week 3 Slides <-> link to come

## Session B: Physical interaction

### Objectives:
* Explore the possibilities of physical interaction as the output of a machine learning system.

### Assignment 3:
1. Prototype a physical interaction as the output of a machine learning model using any of the tools or techniques demonstrated in weeks 2 and 3. This can be a new idea or build off of your week 2 assignment.
2. Document your exercise in a blog post and add a link to the post and your sketch on the [Assignment 3 Wiki](https://github.com/ml5js/Intro-ML-Arts-IMA/wiki/Assignment-3). In your blog post, include visual documentation such as a recorded screen capture / video of your training session and sketch running in the browser. How the readings inform your idea and development of the project?
