# DIY Neural Network

## Session A: Data Collection

### Objectives:
* Understand the full story of building a ML model for classification or regression.
* Understand how data is formatted and downloaded including CSV and JSON.
* Consider how to frame the problem and collect data.
    * Understand critical questions to ask (e.g. Who is this for? What’s the context?)
    * Understand the questions to ask about sourcing and collecting data.
    * Learn how to prepare a data set, including how to normalize and properly format it.
* Diagram the components of a two layer "vanilla" neural network.

## Session B: Training the Model

### Objectives:
* Learn steps to construct a vanilla neural network and train a classification model with ml5.js.
* Understand the terminology of the training process:
    * Training, testing, and validation.
    * “hyper parameters” (We are using “best guess” defaults!)
    * Epochs
    * Batch size
    * Loss
* Understand the difference between training and inference
