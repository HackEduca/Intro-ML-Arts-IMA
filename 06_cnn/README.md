# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Session A: What is CNN?

### Objectives:
* Understand when and why you might train your own model from scratch versus use a pre-trained model or transfer learning.
* Learn the distinction between different types of layers of a neural network, specifically “What is a convolutional layer?”
* Learn about the Google “Quick, Draw!” dataset.
* Understand how to work with image data for training your own model.

### Examples
* Loading drawings from Google Quick, Draw
* Training a model with `ml5.neuralNetwork()` and Google Quick, Draw
* Training a convolutional neural network with Google Quick, Draw and native TensorFlow.js (no ml5)
