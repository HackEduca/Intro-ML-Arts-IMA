## Session B: Deploying the Model

### Objectives
* Review and continue to learn about training a charRNN model.
* Understand how “temperature” affects the charRNN’s generated text.
* Understand the distinction between “stateful” and “stateless” generation.

### Assignment:

#### Reading

#### Instructions
1. Collect a text dataset minimum 5 MB of text.
2. Set up a local or cloud environment and train a model with your own data.
3. Create an interactive sketch with your model and ml5.js.
