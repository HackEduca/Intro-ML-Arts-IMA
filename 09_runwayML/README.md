### Assignment:

#### Reading / Viewing

#### Instructions
1. Research and install a model not demonstrated in class available in RunwayML.
2. Create a p5.js sketch that receives data from RunwayML (using any model).
3. Optionally (instead of or in addition to 2), send data to RunwayML or use another programming environment or software tool besides p5.js.
