# Generative Models with RunwayML

## Session A: Generative Adversarial Networks

### Objectives
* Understand the basics of how the GANs and Image Colorization models in RunwayML work
* Develop high-level understandings of nonlinear dimensionality reductions and the latent space.
* Learn how to use RunwayML with GPU in the cloud.

### Assignment:

#### Reading / Viewing

#### Instructions
1. Prepare a presentation for your final project: a few minutes of slides, computational sketches, and something to illustrate what’s in your head.
2. Includes inspirations, source material, code, ideas for title and 1-sentence description, context, and questions for your peers.
3. Plan to present your idea in ~2-3 minutes leaving about 5 minutes for discussion. You can present your idea however you like visually, but make sure you also document your thoughts in a blog post.
