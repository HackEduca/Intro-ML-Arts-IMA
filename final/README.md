# Final Project

Your final project is a four week assignment to be completed in three stages (proposal, development and testing, presentation). Proposals presentations will be next week (11/11 and 11/13). Final project presentations will be 12/9 and 12/11.

The final project should be a creative project that builds off of or is inspired by the concepts we've covered this semester. You should feel free to think non-traditionally, projects do not need to be screen-based and there is no requirement to use a particular programming language or machine learning model.

Final projects can be collaborations with anyone in any class. Final projects can be one part of a larger project integrated with a different class. Just be transparent about what you are doing.

Other notes:

1. Keeping things simple and small in scope is a plus. If your project idea is a big one, consider documenting the larger idea but implementing just a small piece of it.
2. Also think about making a final project for a small audience, even one single person like a family member or friend. . . or yourself.  This can be a good way to focus your idea and design process.  "Generalizing" the idea can come later (or maybe not at all.)

## Proposal Guidelines

It's up to you to determine how to best present your idea. Be prepared to present for a few minutes with visual aids. Show us your inspirations or make a prototype (even if it's just on paper). At a minimum, prepare the following:

* Project title.
* One sentence description: Can you summarize your idea in one sentence? Stick to the facts -- what are you planning to make?
* Project abstract: ~250 word description of your project.
* Inspiration: How did you become interested in this idea?
* Visual reference: Drawings, photos, artworks, texts, or other media that relate to your idea.
* Audience: Who are you making the project for? How do you expect your audience to interact with your piece? What will their experience be like?
* Challenges: What is your biggest technical and/or conceptual challenge you anticipate?
* Code sketches: This is not required but if you have sketches in progress share them as additional links for feedback.

Document the above elements in a blog post and selectively edit the material to present with slides. [Link to your post and slides on the proposal wiki](https://github.com/ml5js/Intro-ML-Arts-IMA/wiki/Final-Proposals). Plan to present your idea in ~-3-4 minutes leaving about 5 minutes for discussion.

### Guidelines for Giving Proposal Feedback

* Is the idea clear? What do you understand / not understand?
* Is the scope reasonable? Can it be done in such a short period of time?
* Any suggestions for relevant tutorials, examples, or other resources?
